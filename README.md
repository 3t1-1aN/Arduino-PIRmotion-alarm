# Arduino PIR Motion Alarm

An **Arduino-based** alarm clock that uses an RTC module to keep time and a PIR motion sensor as the only way to turn the alarm off. [page:1]  
You have to move in front of the sensor for about a minute before the alarm stops ringing. [page:1]

## Overview

- Uses an RTC clock module for accurate timekeeping. [page:1]  
- Uses a PIR motion sensor to detect movement in front of the clock. [page:1]  
- Requires you to physically get up and move to silence the alarm. [page:1]  
- Uses a speaker/buzzer for the alarm sound. [page:1]
