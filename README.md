# Arduino PIR Motion Alarm

An **Arduino-based** alarm clock that uses an RTC module to keep time and a PIR motion sensor as the only way to turn the alarm off. 
You have to move in front of the sensor for about a minute before the alarm stops ringing.

## Overview

- Uses an RTC clock module for accurate timekeeping.
- Uses a PIR motion sensor to detect movement in front of the clock.
- Requires you to physically get up and move to silence the alarm.
- Uses a speaker/buzzer for the alarm sound.

## Hardware
